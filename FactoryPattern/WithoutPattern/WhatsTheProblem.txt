What is the Problem of the above code implementation?

The above code implementation introduces the following problems

First, the tight coupling between the client class (Program) and Product Class (MoneyBack, Titanium, and Platinum).
Secondly, if we add a new Credit Card, then also we need to modify the Main method by adding an extra if-else condition which not only overheads in the development but also in the testing process
Let us see how to overcome the above problem by using the factory design pattern.
